        LTD. was founded in Israel in 1995 by Michal and Ilan Laor. The LAOR'S 
        business and entrepreneurial experience began over 15 years ago when in 
        1986 they established their first business, which would become the first 
        of several. In Texas, USA they set up an ice cream vendor business and 
        then a traveling taco stand. In Melbourne, Australia, they were pioneers 
        in the food delivery service. Also during their stay in Australia they 
        established a clothing business, a floral foam business and a toy company. 
        <br>

<img src="images/ani_p1.gif" align="right" width=185 height=136 alt="" border="0">Upon their return to Israel, the Laors developed and marketed new and exciting ideas for leading companies in Israel, before founding LAOR TOYS LTD. in 1995, which today
is solely an export company. LAOR TOYS has traditionally dedicated itself to invention, design, development and manufacture of unique concepts and novelty items, primarily for children. LAOR specializes in products, projects and concepts that have potential for unlimited volume and marketing potential. LAOR TOYS has generally always been responsible 
for the actual creation, design and manufacture of the product itself.
<br><br>

LAOR TOYS maintains a factory with plastic injection and foil packaging machines, which are owned fully by LAOR. The company employs the factory on a price per unit basis, which has consistently allowed prices to remain stable and low, enabling sales in great volume to the customer abroad. LAOR also employs graphic artists  and a professional office staff.<br>

One of LAOR TOYS' most distinct advantages in the toy industry today is the extensive
and solid relationships that have been established with the leading toy companies 
and top distributors in the field, all over the world.
LAOR TOYS has proven to be not only an ingenious and creative inventor and developer, 
but a reliable and excellent business partner. These ties with the leading distributors 
worldwide are key factors, which will advocate the success of any new product.<br><br>

In 1995 Michal and Ilan LAOR created their first "hit" product, the JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> -<br> a family
of 36 collectable plastic figurines made in a variety of dazzling colors - which  sold 
in quantities by the millions and which would eventually pave the way 
for LAOR TOYS as leading company in its field. To date, LAOR TOYS LTD.
has manufactured and sold over 170 million JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>.
