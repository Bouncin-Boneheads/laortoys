        <u>JOJO'S</u><br>
        <br>
The JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>  were first introduced in Israel in 1995 and sales surpassed 9,000,000 
units in six months. In late 1996 early 1997 the JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> found their way into France.
TF1, the major broadcast network and distribution company in France
got behind the project and over 70,000,000 units were sold in nine months.
<br><br>

The JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>  were used by several promotional partners including Nestle, Danone,
Esso, Chups, Krema (a Kraft subsidiary) and Disney. Furthermore
LAOR TOYS has licensed companies worldwide to produce 
a variety of JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>  merchandising items such as sneakers, linens and even 
a compact disc featuring the JOJO'S<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> campaign was launched 
in South Africa in the summer of 1999 and became a national craze, selling millions.
In addition, the product was re-introduced in France in February 1999, 
and throughout 1999 and the first part of 2000, the JOJO'S were sold in mass volume in Denmark.
<br><br>
In the United States  LAOR TOYS and IMPERIAL TOY 
CORPORATIONS have teamed up to make the Original JOJO'S Bouncin'
Boneheads! phenomenon. IMPERIAL TOY conducted a massive television
campaign all throughout the United States and pursued the major brand names in America
to use the JOJO'S as a promotional item. In addition to the exciting family of JOJO'S figurines,
IMPERIAL TOY launched a wide array of JOJO'S products and games.<br><br>

LAOR is currently enthusiastically pursuing the production of the JOJO'S animation series and possible motion picture, which promises to capture the hearts and minds of children all over the world.<br><br>

<u>SKIDEEZ/SlLIDERS</u><br><br>
The SKIDEEZ  are a LAOR TOYS creation which originally consisted of  a family of 24 original designs for collectable figurines designed to magically skid and slide on a metal ball which is inserted 
into the figurine. <br><br>

In 1999 the SKIDEEZ were sold to P&M Licensing in Spain, and were called Shockers.
 The campaign met with great success throughout this territory.<br><br>

The SKIDEEZ/SHOCKERS  are produced by LAOR at its manufacturing facilities in Israel.<br><br>

Also in 1999, the SKIDEEZ  concept was licensed to OddzOn Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro,
the largest toy company in the world. OddzOn changed the name to SLIDERS and created an entire line of original designs called WARPEDOS, and received the POKEMON 
and WWF licenses for the SLIDERS.<br><br>

The POKEMON SLIDERS sold more than 2 million blisters (3 units in each blister) with unbelievable success all over the world including North America, South America and the UK. The POKEMON SLIDERS were also voted by Parents' Magazine (November 2000 issue) as "Best Toy of the Year".<br><br>

The SLIDERS and WARPEDOS lines are now once again the sole property 
of LAOR TOYS  including all of the original designs created by OddzOn and are
to be sold worldwide by LAOR.<br><br>
